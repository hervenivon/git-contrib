# git-contrib

This is my own python program toy to customize GitHub contribution calendar 👾 (see GitHub documentation [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/viewing-contributions-on-your-profile))

I used it as a way to learn things 😁.

## Usage

## Dependencies

## Pre-requisites

Conda must be [installed](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#regular-installation).

Then create an environment dedicated to this project:

1. Create `conda` environment: `$> conda create --name gt python=3.7 requests ipython`
2. Activate `conda` environment: `$> conda activate gt`
3. Install other requirements: `$> pip install -r requirements.txt`
